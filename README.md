# Introduction

NFT-based collectibles are gaining popularity in DeFi markets but currently exist largely as art assets without intrinsic value and utility. We decided to create a project where charity, art, and blockchain intertwine. This NFT project aims to gather and build a strong dog-lovers community and help stray dogs get the love and care that they deserve. 

# Background
Common problem here in the Philippines is that there are many stray dogs in the streets. We cannot blame them for roaming around because they donâ€™t have shelter or a home to stay in and they look for food to survive. But we cannot also hide the facts that these dogs also present safety issues when they roam in packs, causing traffic accidents, attacking residents, and spreading disease.

As a team with members that are soft-hearted when it comes to dogs and has enough knowledge of blockchain technology, we found an opportunity to solve this problem by launching our own NFT art collection project that features different kinds of stray dogs. An NFT art is a digital asset that is collectible, unique, and non-transferable. Every NFT is unique in its creative design and cannot be duplicated, making them limited and rare.

# What is Project Strays?

It is a limited edition NFT collection with instrinic value and utility that aims to help stray dogs here (but not limited to) in the Philippines.
