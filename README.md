#Introduction

NFT-based collectibles are gaining popularity in DeFi markets but currently exist largely as art assets without intrinsic value and utility. We decided to create a project where charity, art, and blockchain intertwine. This NFT project aims to gather and build a strong dog-lovers community and help stray dogs get the love and care that they deserve.
