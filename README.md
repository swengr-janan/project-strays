# Introduction

NFT-based collectibles are gaining popularity in DeFi markets but currently exist largely as art assets without intrinsic value and utility. We decided to create a project where charity, art, and blockchain intertwine. This NFT project aims to gather and build a strong dog-lovers community and help stray dogs get the love and care that they deserve. 

# What is Project Strays?

It is a limited edition NFT collection with instrinic value and utility that aims to help stray dogs here (but not limited to) in the Philippines. 

# Total Supply
3,333 free-ranging urban dogs

# Blockchain
